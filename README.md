## Comments

* On the product detail page, I did not succeed to interact with the drop down selector used for the size selection. 
I have only used one size product for the testing.

* The cucumber steps can be updated to be more reusable.

* For this project, I don't have used the data driven approach, even if the file TestData-seleniumframework.xlsx is loaded.
